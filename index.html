		<h1>Writer, Traveller, Entreprenuer and Full Time Thinker</h1>
		<p>One can not measure insight or wisdom on the axis of time alone, but rather on those of experience, strife and resilience. In spite of my mere quarter of a century on Earth so far, I've had the good fortune to amass quite a range of experiences, with successes and failures alike.</p>

		<p>From my high school band getting kicked off the stage by the next artist to perform, who later came to be known as Lady Gaga, to writing half of a novel in a month while aboard a cargo ship crossing the Pacific Ocean, to overseeing billions of dollars in daily trading for the largest hedge fund in the world, to narrowly escaping bleeding to death in a roadside ditch in the remote mountains of northern Laos, every experience I've taken something away about myself and the world I inhabit.</p>
		<p>What follows are thoughts, insights and life lessons I've gained along thge way. My opinions are based on reasoning, experience and knowledge, not how they might be recieved, and I reserve the right to the healthy practice of changing my mind. Whether you find me refreshingly candid or brazenly idiotic, you will always find me unapologetically sincere. The path to wisdom often takes one by many a painful truth, but if I've learned anything in my life, its that ignorance is the one thing that hurts worse.</p>

		<h2>The First Question</h2>
		<p>While the universal question, 'why are we here?', will may forever remain unanswered, at least in any scientifically provable manner, it is vital to at least grapple with. Without this question, even unanswered, there can be no other questions.</p>
		<p>To me, the answer is happiness, which I puport is more than just the next best thing to pursue in leiu of 'proven' answer. A deep, comphrehensive happiness, unlike cheap, temporary thrills and pleasures, is the complete fulfillment of one's existence across many dimensions of human experience and identity. I believe there are six distinct elements of life, all of which one must satisfy, for one to be truly happy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self Acceptance</li>
		<li>Social Engagement</li>
		<li>Physical/Material Security</li>
		<li>Metaphysical Exploration</li>
		<li>Sense of Purpose</li>
		<li>Creative Expression</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I see knowledge as critical to happiness in each of these elements, perhaps self acceptance and physical or material security being the areas where this is most immediately apparent. Knowledge and truth are not mere nice things to have, painful things to avoid, or unecessary byproducts, but the foundations with which we can begin to pursue happiness in each of these dimensions. Through an examination of thoughts, experiences and insights pertaining to one or more of these six areas, we gain futher understanding in those relevant areas, and I thus see a step towards a successful pursuit of knowledge, which both parallels and enables a successful pursuit of happiness, and in turn, a successful life itself.
